My favorite place to visit is Rome, Italy! Maybe it's just because it's where my wife and I honeymooned, but it was truly breathtaking!
Other countries/places I've been to include India, Hong Kong, Macau, Canada, Mexico, France, Spain, Germany, and ...I think that's everything, other than a layover.
States I've been to: California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Maine, Hawaii, and Alaska. ...I also think that's everything, also not including layovers. lol!
