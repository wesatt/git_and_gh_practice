Well...the reasons I'm changing careers are multiple, and a little personal. But a huge part of it was the support and encouragement of my friends and family. I also just needed a big change in my life after the last couple of years. It's been rough politically and pandemically. Sometimes I feel like I'm one of the few people left who is still trying to take as many measures as possible to avoid contracting and spreading Covid. But I digress...
